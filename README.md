# Flexbox Challenge

In this challenge, we'll test your understanding of Flexbox in CSS. Modify the template to the right in the following ways:

1. Add a ```flex display``` to the ```.flex-container``` element, notice how it affects the items elements inside of it.

2. Change the flex direction so that all the ```.flex-item``` elements are stacked vertically instead of horizontally (ie. change the main axis to the Y axis).

3. Now change the main axis back so the elements are in a row again.

***

1. Modify the ```.flex-container``` so that it's child elements wrap around the page when compressed instead of squashing together. 

2. Using the ```justify-content``` property, align the items in the center of the main axis.

3. Using the ```align-items``` property, align the items in the center of the cross axis.

    - The elements should now be centered in on the browser

4. Play around with other ways of aligning things using ```justify-content``` and ```align-items```

    - ie. ```space-around```, ```space-between```, ```flex-start```, ```flex-end```.
